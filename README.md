# Cubli_ENS_Rennes
Description of the work done during the Cubli projetc, and how to duplicate it.

The Cubli project started in February 2018 and ended in April 2018. It was an educational project, aiming to create a model and using it as an educational object. The goal was to stabilise a cube using an inertial wheel, in order to orientate an educational satellite (Heptasat) without using propulsion. 

This project was conducted by two students studying the master degree \textit{Engineering of complex systems} at the ENS Rennes, in cooperation with the CNES.
